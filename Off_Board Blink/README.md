# Off Board Blink
For this part of the lab I had to make 2 LED's blink at different rates. But I had to do this with the MSP430G2553 processor and extract the processor chip off the board and place it on a breadboard and build a circuit around it. 

Now that we have the whole blinking LED out of the way, why don't we try making things a little more convenient by taking the G2553 off the development board and into a breadboard. In addition to the software, your README needs to also contain a picture of your circuit with at least 2 LEDs blinking all on a breadboard and without a development board. This means that you will need:

# Processor Used
 MSP430G2553

## Dependencies
The only dependency is the library called MSP430.h. this is used for all TI MSP 430 processors.
