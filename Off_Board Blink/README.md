# Off Board Blink
For this part of the lab I had to make 2 LED's blink at different rates. But I had to do this with the MSP430G2553 processor and extract the processor chip off the board and place it on a breadboard and build a circuit around it. I had to use a 47k resistor to limit the current to the LED. One of the files above show a video of the LEDs blinking as they should. 

# Processor Used
 MSP430G2553

## Dependencies
The only dependency is the library called MSP430.h. this is used for all TI MSP 430 processors.
